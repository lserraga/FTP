    Just excecute the client and the terminal in two different directories
    with its respective parameters:
    ./ftpserver <listening-port>
    ./ftpclient <server-ip> <server‐listen­port>
    You can now excecute get, put, ls and quit commands in the client.


    TESTING:

    	For the testing I have made 2 python scripts and also a c program to
    test the server commands.

    	commandsTest.py : just excecute it with python3 test/commandsTest.py
    in the main directory. It uses testingCommandsServer.c which is a 
    program that sends the raw messages that the user inputs. So we can
    directly test the behaviour of the server when it receives server
    commands (POTS,STOR,RETR,QUIT,LIST and PORT).

    	mainTest.py : just excecute it with python3 test/mainTest.py
    in the main directory. The test files in the test directory are used 
    to test the get function (the server is excecuted in the test and 
    the client in testOut directory). For the put test, it creates a 
    100MB file with random data and it sends it to the server.
    It also check the list command checking various directories and
    finally the quit command. At the end it deletes all the new created
    files.
