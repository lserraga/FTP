  Linux command terminal.

  Documentation
  -------------

  Included in the doc directory.

  Installation
  ------------

  Executing make in the main directory compiles all the files
  needed.

  Files
  --------
  /bin/
      myclient : excecutable for myserver.c
      myserver : excecutable for myclient.c

      usage.txt : Documentation of the design usage.

  /src/
      myserver.c : contains the code for the implementation of the
      server. Imports functions from the following libraries: sys/types.h,
      sys/socket.h, strings.h, string.h, arpa/inet.h, stdio.h, stdlib.h,
      unistd.h and error.h
      myclient.c : contains the code for the implementation of the
      client. Imports functions from the following libraries: sys/types.h,
      sys/socket.h, strings.h, string.h, arpa/inet.h, stdio.h, stdlib.h,
      unistd.h and error.h
      error.c : contains plenty of functions for error handling and also
      wrapping functions for the sys/socket.h and arpa/inet.h functions.
      All used from the unp.h library included in the book UNIX Network
      Programming, Volume 1, Third Edition, The Sockets Networking API
      error.h : contains the headers for the error.c functions
      Makefile : compiles both myclient and myserver using error.c and
      error.h as sources. Also contains a clean function

  /ex1testdir3571234612123421
      Directory created by test_ex1.py to test different easy functions.

  Makefile : calls the Makefile in /src/ and also includes a clean
  function

  test_ex1.py: python script to test a set of basic commands. "I don't
  know how to test other bigger functions but they still work"
